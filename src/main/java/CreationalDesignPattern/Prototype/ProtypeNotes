Prototype is creational design pattern that lets you copy existing
objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

for example:
the classmate notebook has same ruled page oof say 120 pages,only differnce
 was their of the funfacts at the end of the notebook,so instead of creating 1000s of notebook
 we can create one notebook and then clone it.and after cloning at those funfacts at the
 end of the notebook/

 Similarly we can clone the objects of the class and then use it.

 steps to create prototype:
  lets consider scaler student as example
  so, In scaler student joining may have differnet batch, student name,
    student id,student email,student phone number,student address,student college name
    but for one batch it may have same instructor name, same course name, same course id,
    same course duration, same course fee, same course start date, same course end date.
  so in this case create s atudent class and then create a prototype of it and then clone it.

  Here one issue is their we may need resgister to maintain various types of prototype
  for that we can use registry design pattern.

  So registry design pattern will have  a map which will have key as string and value as
  object or prototype

  and two function one will register the prototype and other will return the clone of the
    prototype.
