 why we made Amazon(publisher) as Singleton.
 Single Source of Events: Ensuring that there is only one instance of the publisher helps
 maintain a single source of events. If there were multiple instances of the publisher,
 observers might need to register with each instance separately, leading to potential
 confusion and a lack of consistency in the system.
